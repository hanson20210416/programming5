3,A "slot" is the Open MPI term for an allocatable unit where we can
3,launch a process.  The number of slots available are defined by the
3,environment in which Open MPI processes are run:

3,  1. Hostfile, via "slots=N" clauses (N defaults to number of
3,     processor cores if not provided)

3,  4. If none of a hostfile, the --host command line parameter, or an
3,     RM is present, Open MPI defaults to the number of processor cores

3,In all the above cases, if you want Open MPI to default to the number
